High priority:
    try to fix the mouseover problem for phones
    make god only take your stuff if you have stuff

Medium priority:
    use more constants and less hardcoding
    make items do more stuff (cats save you, sailor peg as floation device)
    log stuff when errors happen
    experiment with responsive views in boostrap
    make the game run faster? (better hardware? fatter client?)
    provide a loading indication so the user knows their command was sent
    more outcomes for lick the ground

Low priority:
    look for options that are too safe
    minify code
    look into gzipping code
    change the display if I get more feedback about it being bad
    make flirting less linear (lose track of Olga, think up poem for Felicity)
    spellcheck the game (once things settle down)
